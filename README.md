# SOC---gesture-control-

##Soc_task2 
The task was inspired from [here](https://github.com/asingh33/CNNGestureRecognizer/blob/master/README.md/).
I have trained model using transfer learning using Resnet50 model to distinguish between five hand gestures, namely:-
- One
- Two
- Three
- Four
- Five 

The model manages to achieve 95% (191/200) accuracy on test images.

The trained model is used to identify the gesture from input given from live vedio capturing. 
videogesture.py can be run on terminal with weights loaded from here.
